🚀 **Bank Loan Case Study: Understanding Loan Default Patterns** 📊  

I conducted an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key factors influencing loan defaults, enabling better loan approval decisions for a financial institution. This analysis helps mitigate risks and improve business profitability.

### **Project Objectives**:  
1️⃣ **Analyze Patterns in Loan Defaults**: Identify attributes leading to payment difficulties.  
2️⃣ **Optimize Loan Approval Decisions**: Ensure capable applicants are not rejected while minimizing financial risks.

### **Tasks Performed**:  
✅ **Missing Data Handling**:  
- Identified missing values using Excel functions like `ISBLANK` and `COUNT`.  
- Applied appropriate methods like mean/median imputation for numerical data.

✅ **Outlier Detection**:  
- Detected outliers using **IQR** and statistical measures to prevent skewed analysis.  

✅ **Data Imbalance Analysis**:  
- Assessed the target variable (loan default) distribution to identify class imbalances.  
- Found a higher proportion of successful loans compared to defaults.

✅ **Univariate, Segmented, and Bivariate Analysis**:  
- **Univariate**: Analyzed individual variables like loan amount, income, and age.  
- **Segmented Univariate**: Compared data distributions between defaulters and non-defaulters.  
- **Bivariate**: Explored relationships between variables like loan amount, repayment status, and income using pivot tables and scatter plots.  

✅ **Correlation Analysis**:  
- Identified **top correlations** for different customer scenarios using `CORREL`.  
- Highlighted the strongest indicators of loan default, such as income, loan type, and education levels.

### **Key Insights**:  
🔹 **Default Patterns**:  
   - Default rates decrease with higher education levels and greater work experience.  
   - Unemployed clients and those with large families have the **highest default risks**.  

🔹 **Gender and Age**:  
   - Women receive more loans, but men have lower default rates.  
   - Older clients borrow larger amounts but are less likely to default.  

🔹 **Loan Type**:  
   - **Cash loans** are the most common but carry higher risk in specific demographics.

### **Results**:  
The analysis uncovered critical trends and actionable insights to improve **loan approval strategies**. By understanding these patterns, banks can better manage risks, offer tailored interest rates, and prioritize lending to low-risk applicants.
